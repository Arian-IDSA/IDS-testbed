# Suggestion for Roadmap from SICK

## 1. Architectural diagram of the components
We need a minimun definiton of all Components for a testbed.

## 2. Component documentation
We need for every Component of the defined testbed the following documents:
    - Installation of updates
    - Hardware and software requirements
    - List of protocols and ports used for each component
    - wiring plan
    - Description of the configuration options for each component
    - Step by step instructions for commissioning
    - Description of the communication channels
    - Specification of all licenses used (software, libraries, ...)
    - implemented security measures
    - Flow charts for the process execution
    - Description of the steps necessary to remove / replace a component

## 3. Review
SICK will review the documents for every Component and give Feedback.

## 4. Construction
SICK need the Component (Software/Hardware) an build the Testbed in Waldkirch.
So we can make a proof of operability of the Testbed.

## 5. CA (certification authority)
SICK Install the CA into the Testbed.

## 6. CA
SICK make a proof the functionality of the CA.

# Feedback/Open Points
Feedback Weekly Meeting 27.04.2021:
* 1st step: specifications of all components
* 2. Components: every partner responsible for specifications of a component will provide this information
* Roadmap for every component once specifications are finalized
