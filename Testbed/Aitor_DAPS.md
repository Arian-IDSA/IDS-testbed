## The DAPS server requires the public keys (.cert) from those components that wish to obtain a DAT from it.
## This .cert file should be placed in the "keys" directory within the DAPS directory
## For the time being, these certificates will be the ones provided by Fraunhoder AISEC. For the time being, you can use a certificate located in the "certs" folder in the "Testbed" folder. If you wanna get your own certificate and use it in the Testbed, request one in: https://industrialdataspace.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-2002 (Requires Jive access).
